We are mainly using two method to check that any website uses WordPress or not.
The first one is using default login dashboard(wp-admin) and the second one is by checking some 
keywords like wp-content,wp-includes.

In the first method if we got login page by adding wp-admin in the url then we can say that it uses
WordPress.
In the second method we check the keywords in the source code of the website if we found the words
then we can say that it uses WordPress.

And the same method(like second method) we can use for checking version of the WordPress.
